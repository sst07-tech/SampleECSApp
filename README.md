 Amazon ECS - Amazon ECS makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale Docker containers running applications, services, and batch processes. Amazon ECS places containers across your cluster based on your resource needs and is integrated with familiar features like Elastic Load Balancing, EC2 security groups, EBS volumes and IAM roles.

Clusters - An Amazon ECS cluster is a regional grouping of one or more container instances on which you can run task requests. Each account receives a default cluster the first time you use the Amazon ECS service. Clusters may contain more than one Amazon EC2 instance type.
